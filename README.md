# Alpha EnergySense Industrial AI

Alpha EnergySense Industrial AI is an Industry 4.0 focused energy monitoring and
AI-assisted analytics demo platform designed for industrial facilities.

This project is developed as a **working prototype** for *Sənaye 4.0: Hackathon 2025*.

---

##  Project Purpose

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how industrial energy consumption
can be analyzed, monitored, and optimized using **AI-supported data analytics**
without requiring physical sensors at the demo stage.

The system is designed to be **sensor-ready** and can be directly integrated with
real industrial data sources.

##  Key Features

-  Real-time & historical energy consumption visualization  
-  Peak detection & anomaly alerts  
-  AI-assisted baseline prediction (simulated data)  
-  Professional industrial dashboard (Plant Manager View)  
-  Live data simulation for demo purposes  

---

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js  
- **Backend / Logic:** Python (planned for AI & data processing)  
- **Data Analytics:** Simulated industrial datasets  
- **Visualization:** Interactive dashboards  
- **AI Concept:** Trend analysis, anomaly detection, basic forecasting  

---

##  How the Demo Works

This version uses **simulated energy consumption data** to demonstrate:

1. Data collection and storage logic  
2. Visualization of consumption trends  
3. Detection of abnormal energy spikes  
4. AI-supported interpretation of industrial patterns  

No physical sensors are required at this stage.

##  Future Sensor Integration

The system is designed to integrate with:
- Smart meters
- Industrial IoT sensors
- SCADA / PLC data sources
- Energy management systems

Real sensor data can be connected without changing the dashboard structure.

---

##  How to Run the Demo

1. Download or clone the repository  
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser  
3. Click **"Refresh Data"** to simulate live energy updates  

No installation required.

##  Hackathon Note

This project focuses on **functional demonstration and system logic**
rather than hardware deployment.

The goal is to prove system feasibility and industrial applicability.
